## Profile
> [!info] Appearance
> ```Appearance
> Gorax Deepstone is a towering turtle-man with rugged, mossy green scales and a weathered, stone-like shell marked with scars from his travels. His golden eyes gleam with quiet wisdom beneath a broad brow, and his beak-like jaw is sharp yet dignified. He wears a wide-brimmed hat adorned with feathers and beads, and his attire is a mix of earthy leather and vibrant cloth. His long, clawed fingers are surprisingly nimble when playing his accordion, and he carries a satchel filled with musical instruments—a lute, a bone flute, and a small drum. Despite his slow movements, there's graceful energy when he performs.

>[!info] Background
>```Background
>Abandoned at birth, Gorax Deepstone has had it rough his whole life. He had to learn everything all on his own until at the age of 7, when he was adopted by a circus owner, who only saw him as a way to earn more money. Gorax’s adoptive father made him perform every night without any breaks for 11 years until Jaol, an 18-year-old human joined the circus and accidentally killed his abusive father when his knife-throwing performance didn’t go as planned.
>
>Gorax fell in love with Jaol and they ran away from the circus together, framing an innocent bear-owl in his father’s death. Jaol taught Gorax to play the accordion and they’ve been each other’s biggest supporters ever since then, travelling and performing music together in every tavern they see for free stays.
>
>Although Jaol loves all the attention and the constant moving, Gorax is starting to get tired of the routine and wants to slow down and settle down somewhere.
