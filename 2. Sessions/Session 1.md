>[!note]- Story notes
>	[[Goth Mog]] First went to the Starlit Tavern and met [[Yvenne Sylthara]], he was trying to hit up on her, failed and proceed to go to the bar and get a pint but [[Gorax Deepstone]] was able to see through his lies, and gave him orange juices instead with 2 drop of pint. Later [[Gorax Deepstone]] went to talk to [[Yvenne Sylthara]] about how there was a rich merchant in town looking for help in the search of the daughter, and she should head to the Library to get infomation, [[Gorax Deepstone]] Did the same for [[Goth Mog]] and so [[Yvenne Sylthara]] went and [[Goth Mog]] Follow closely behind still trying to flirt. Once at the Library they heard a commotion and head towards the noise. This is where they met and introduction to [[Dood]] and [[The Grand Wizard Man]], [[Dood]] was just chewed on by his mother and is now trying to read a book assigned to him while she assign [[The Grand Wizard Man]] to baby sit [[Dood]] and teach him how to read, Sadly [[The Grand Wizard Man]] does not have his glasses and can't see very well. Even Though [[Dood]] had some glasses on hand, every time he gives one to [[The Grand Wizard Man]] he crushes it due to his carelessness. During the commotion [[The Grand Wizard Man]] seem to spot [[Goth Mog]] and due to PTSD with orc he immediately start running away but the only way out was to run pass [[Goth Mog]] so as he run pass he curses at [[Goth Mog]] saying 'Green Fucker', [[Dood]] sees [[The Grand Wizard Man]] running and procced to chase after but with his low intelligence he forgot immediately why he was running to [[The Grand Wizard Man]] and just kept running. They all moved together and now got towards the Librarian and his assistance where they ask any info about the job and where to find this merchant man. They were informed that the quest has been officially handed out in the Starlit Tavern and you can get info from there. So they all went together to head back, Before leaving [[Yvenne Sylthara]] tried to flirt with the Librarian but didn't go too well to say the least while the librarian remain professional but he is interested. The party head back to the area where they first met [[Dood]] and [[The Grand Wizard Man]], they look around and try to find the teleporter from what [[Selena]] told them. After a while manage to find it and got teleported.
